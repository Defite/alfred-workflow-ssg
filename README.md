## Alfred Workflow for Static Site Generators

Helps to choose generator and create new site without remembering cli commands.

### Static site generators (and frameworks) support

For now workflow supports not so many tools:

- [Gatsby.js](https://gatsbyjs.com/)
- [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/)
- [Next.js](http://nextjs.org/)

There will be more ssg and frameworks added soon.
